# Text-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Python
In this project I have separated my code into a number of files, instead of using the notebook to interact with Python- closer to how a real-life project would be structured.

To facilitate this via Colaboratory, I have mounted my Google Drive storage to the notebook so I can use it like a regular file system. After this, I moved on to completing a fully functional code-base which allowed me to train models, then save and load them to disk for later usage.

I demonstrate this with a text sentiment task - classifying a piece of text as either positive or negative in sentiment.

For example:

"I hated this movie" - negative.
"The best pasta has lots of cheese" - positive.
The dataset I have used is Kaggle's Sentiment Analysis for Financial News, which consists of financial headlines and a score of 0 or 1 for negative and positive sentiment, respectively.
